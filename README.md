# 🩺 Disease Prediction Engine

> AI-powered symptom-to-disease prediction API — part of the **Ai_healthcare** platform.  
> Branch: `disease-prediction-engine`

---

## 📌 What It Does

User selects symptoms → Model predicts **Top 5 most likely diseases** with confidence scores → API returns ranked predictions with remedies.

Built on a **Neural Network** trained on a 773-class symptom-disease dataset with **85.6% accuracy**.

## 🧠 How The Model Works

```
User Input (symptoms list)
        ↓
Map symptoms → 377-dim binary vector
        ↓
Neural Network Inference
  Input(377) → Dense(1024) → Dense(1024) → Softmax(773)
        ↓
Top 5 predictions with confidence scores (Softmax probabilities)
        ↓

**Training Details:**
- Dataset: Kaggle Symptom-Disease dataset
- Classes: 773 diseases
- Input: 377 binary symptom features
- Accuracy: **85.6%**
- Early stopping applied

## 🚀 API Reference

### Base URL
```
https://ai-healtcare.onrender.com
```

### `POST /predict`

Predicts top diseases based on input symptoms.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "symptoms": [
    "fever",
    "headache",
    "vomiting"
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "input_symptoms": [
    "fever",
    "headache",
    "vomiting"
  ],
  "predictions": [
    {
      "disease": "malaria",
      "confidence": 0.82
    },
    {
      "disease": "typhoid",
      "confidence": 0.11
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**
- Symptoms must match entries in `symptoms_list.json`
- Returns top 5 predictions sorted by confidence (descending)
- Confidence values are Softmax probabilities (0.0 – 1.0)
- If confidence < 0.40 → app shows **"Consult a doctor"** warning

### `GET /symptoms`

Returns the full list of valid symptom strings.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "symptoms": ["fever", "headache", "vomiting", "...377 total"]
}
```
